# OOP - Object Oriented Programing

## What

- Is the programing technical base on class and object.
- is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.


### The 4 basics concept
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**


## Why

### Pros

- Provides a clear structure for the programs.
- Modularity for easier troubleshooting.
- **Reusability**. Code can be reused through inheritance.
- Flexibility through polymorphism
- **Productivity**. Programmers can construct new programs quicker through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.
- **Easily upgradable and scalable.** Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
- **Security**. Using encapsulation and abstraction.


### Cons
- OOP code may be more **complicated to write** and **take longer to compile.**
- Programming Complexity
- Large Program Size
- Slower Programs
